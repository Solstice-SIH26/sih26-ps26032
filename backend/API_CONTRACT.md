# API Contract — SIH PS26032 Backend (v3: pending/approve workflow)

Base URL during dev: `http://localhost:8000`

## Auth

**None implemented yet.** No headers, tokens, or cookies required on any
endpoint below — including admin ones. IDs are passed directly by the
client. JWT verification (Supabase Auth) is planned once login is working
on the auth side.

The one exception is the new voice endpoint in section 5, which is called
server-to-server by Vapi and is protected by a static bearer secret
(`VAPI_WEBHOOK_SECRET`) rather than a farmer JWT.

---

## 1. Token statuses (exact enum)

| Value | Meaning | Set by |
|---|---|---|
| `pending` | Farmer submitted a request, awaiting staff review | `POST /tokens` (default) |
| `waiting` | Staff approved it — has a `token_number` and `time_slot` now | `PATCH /tokens/{id}/approve` |
| `called` | Staff has called this token up | `PATCH /tokens/{id}/status` |
| `completed` | Transaction done | `PATCH /tokens/{id}/status` |
| `rejected` | Staff declined the pending request | `PATCH /tokens/{id}/reject` |
| `cancelled` | Farmer or staff cancelled (only from `pending`/`waiting`) | `PATCH /tokens/{id}/cancel` |

Flow: `pending → waiting → called → completed`, with `pending → rejected`
and `pending`/`waiting` → `cancelled` as off-ramps.

---

## 2. Endpoints

### `POST /tokens`
Farmer submits a procurement request. **Does not join the queue directly** — goes to `pending` for staff review.

**Request body** (all required):
```json
{
  "farmer_id": "3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6",
  "center_id": "9c858901-8a57-4791-81fe-4c455b099bc9",
  "requested_date": "2026-09-10",
  "crop_type": "Wheat",
  "quantity_kg": 500
}
```
| Field | Type | Required |
|---|---|---|
| `farmer_id` | UUID string | yes |
| `center_id` | UUID string | yes |
| `requested_date` | date string `YYYY-MM-DD` | yes |
| `crop_type` | string | yes |
| `quantity_kg` | number | yes |

**Success response — `200 OK`:**
```json
{
  "id": "a1b2c3d4-...",
  "farmer_id": "3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6",
  "center_id": "9c858901-8a57-4791-81fe-4c455b099bc9",
  "requested_date": "2026-09-10",
  "crop_type": "Wheat",
  "quantity_kg": 500,
  "token_number": null,
  "time_slot": null,
  "status": "pending",
  "created_at": "2026-08-28T09:15:00.123456+00:00",
  "updated_at": "2026-08-28T09:15:00.123456+00:00"
}
```
`token_number` and `time_slot` are **`null`** until approved — the frontend should handle this, not assume they're always populated.

**Error responses:**
- `400 Bad Request` — one of:
  - `{"detail": "farmer_id or center_id does not exist"}` (bad foreign key)
  - `{"detail": "You already have an active request for 2026-09-10."}` (one-per-day rule)
  - `{"detail": "You already have 3 active requests. Cancel one before submitting a new request."}` (max-3-active rule)
- `422 Unprocessable Entity` — missing/invalid field or wrong type
- `500 Internal Server Error` — `{"detail": "Could not create request"}`

---

### `GET /tokens/{id}`
Farmer checks their request/token status. Same response shape as `POST /tokens` above, reflecting current state (`token_number`/`time_slot` populated once approved).

**Errors:** `404` `{"detail": "Token not found"}`; `422` bad UUID.

---

### `PATCH /tokens/{id}/approve`
Staff approves a pending request. **No request body.**

**Success response — `200 OK`:** full token object with `status: "waiting"`, `token_number` and `time_slot` now populated, e.g.:
```json
{ "...": "...", "status": "waiting", "token_number": 3, "time_slot": "09:50" }
```

**Error responses:**
- `404 Not Found` — `{"detail": "Token not found"}`
- `400 Bad Request`:
  - `{"detail": "Only pending requests can be approved (current status: waiting)."}` — wrong current state
  - `{"detail": "Approving this request (500.0kg) would exceed the center's daily capacity (4800.0kg already approved / 5000.0kg limit for 2026-09-10)."}` — capacity exceeded

---

### `PATCH /tokens/{id}/reject`
Staff rejects a pending request. **No request body.**

**Success — `200 OK`:** token object with `status: "rejected"`.
**Errors:** `404` not found; `400` `{"detail": "Only pending requests can be rejected (current status: ...)."}`

---

### `PATCH /tokens/{id}/cancel`
Farmer or staff cancels. Works from `pending` or `waiting` only. **No request body.**

**Success — `200 OK`:** token object with `status: "cancelled"`.
**Errors:** `404` not found; `400` `{"detail": "Only pending or waiting requests can be cancelled (current status: ...)."}`

---

### `PATCH /tokens/{id}/status`
Staff progresses an **already-approved** token through the physical queue. **Only two transitions are accepted: `waiting→called` and `called→completed`.** Everything else (approve/reject/cancel) must use the dedicated endpoints above.

**Request body:**
```json
{ "status": "called" }
```

**Success — `200 OK`:** updated token object.
**Errors:**
- `404` not found
- `400` `{"detail": "Cannot move token from 'pending' to 'called' via this endpoint. Use /approve, /reject, or /cancel for other transitions."}`

---

### `GET /centers`
Unchanged behavior. Optional `?crop_type=` filter. Response now includes `daily_capacity_kg`:
```json
[
  {
    "id": "9c858901-...",
    "name": "Karnal Mandi Center 3",
    "location": "Karnal, Haryana",
    "crop_type": "Wheat",
    "msp_rate": 2425.00,
    "open_date": "2026-09-01",
    "close_date": "2026-09-15",
    "daily_capacity_kg": 5000,
    "is_active": true
  }
]
```

### `GET /centers/{id}`
Same shape as one item above. `404` if not found.

### `POST /centers` / `PATCH /centers/{id}`
Admin center management — unchanged from last version except the body now accepts/returns `daily_capacity_kg` (defaults to `5000` if omitted on create).

### `GET /centers/{id}/queue`
Unchanged URL. `?status=` now accepts any of the 6 statuses — e.g. `?status=pending` to see the approval queue, `?status=waiting` to see who's up next. Ordered by `token_number` (approved tokens first, in order), then `created_at` (pending requests, oldest first).

### `GET /users`
Unchanged. `?role=admin|procurement|farmer` optional filter.

---

## 3. Capacity check — exact logic

On `PATCH /tokens/{id}/approve`:
1. Sum `quantity_kg` of all tokens for the same `center_id` + `requested_date` that are already in `waiting`, `called`, or `completed` (i.e. already approved — `pending` requests don't count yet).
2. If `sum + this_request.quantity_kg > center.daily_capacity_kg` → `400`, nothing changes.
3. Otherwise → token gets `token_number = (count of already-approved) + 1`, `time_slot` assigned by that same position (see below), status → `waiting`.

Rejecting or cancelling a token removes it from this sum automatically — no separate "freeing" step exists or is needed.

## 4. Time slot assignment — exact logic

Fixed-interval spacing in **approval order**, not a scheduling algorithm:
- First approval for a given center+date → `09:00`
- Second → `09:25`
- Third → `09:50`
- ... i.e. `09:00 + (approval_position - 1) × 25 minutes`

Not configurable per center yet. If your team wants different spacing or center-specific hours, that's a small follow-up change — ask.

## 5. Voice (Vapi) — caller identification & context

**Milestone 1 only.** This endpoint identifies the calling farmer and
reports their active requests. It does **not** create, approve, reject,
or change any token — that's a later milestone. It's called by the Vapi
server/webhook layer, not directly by farmers or the frontend.

### `GET /voice/context`

**Auth:** `Authorization: Bearer <VAPI_WEBHOOK_SECRET>` — a server-to-server
secret, distinct from farmer JWTs (which aren't implemented yet anyway).
Missing/wrong header → `401`. If the server itself has no
`VAPI_WEBHOOK_SECRET` configured → `500`.

**Query parameters:**

| Param | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `phone` | string | yes | Caller's number. Accepts a bare 10-digit Indian mobile number, a `91`-prefixed number, or full E.164 (`+91...`). Normalized server-side. |

**Phone normalization examples:**
9876543210 -> +919876543210
919876543210 -> +919876543210
+919876543210 -> +919876543210 (unchanged)

Anything that doesn't match one of these shapes → `400`.

**Resolution logic:**
1. Normalize `phone` to E.164.
2. Look up `profiles` for a row with that `phone` and `role = 'farmer'`.
3. **Match found** → use that farmer. `demo_mode_used: false`.
4. **No match, `DEMO_MODE=true`** → use the farmer identified by
   `DEMO_FARMER_ID`. `demo_mode_used: true`. The demo farmer is a normal
   `profiles` row with `role='farmer'` — it goes through the exact same
   `POST /tokens` limits (max 3 active, one per day) as any real farmer;
   nothing about those rules is bypassed for demo calls.
5. **No match, `DEMO_MODE=false`** → `404`.

**Success response — `200 OK`:**
```json
{
  "demo_mode_used": false,
  "caller_number": "+919876543210",
  "farmer_id": "3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6",
  "farmer_name": "Ramesh Kumar",
  "active_tokens": [
    {
      "id": "a1b2c3d4-...",
      "center_id": "9c858901-...",
      "center_name": "Karnal Mandi Center 3",
      "requested_date": "2026-09-10",
      "crop_type": "Wheat",
      "quantity_kg": 500,
      "token_number": null,
      "time_slot": null,
      "status": "pending"
    }
  ]
}
```
`active_tokens` includes only `pending`, `waiting`, and `called` requests
(same `ACTIVE_STATUSES` used by `POST /tokens`'s own limit checks) — a
farmer with none gets an empty list, not an error. `center_name` is
pulled in via the existing `tokens.center_id -> procurement_centers.id`
relationship, so the caller doesn't need a second lookup.

**Error responses:**
- `400 Bad Request` — `{"detail": "Could not recognize this as an Indian phone number."}`
- `401 Unauthorized` — `{"detail": "Missing or invalid Authorization header"}`
- `404 Not Found` — `{"detail": "No farmer is registered with this number."}` (only when `DEMO_MODE=false`)
- `500 Internal Server Error` — server misconfiguration, e.g.:
  - `{"detail": "VAPI_WEBHOOK_SECRET is not configured on the server."}`
  - `{"detail": "DEMO_MODE is enabled but DEMO_FARMER_ID is not configured."}`
  - `{"detail": "DEMO_FARMER_ID is not a valid UUID."}`
  - `{"detail": "DEMO_FARMER_ID does not match any farmer profile."}`

**Out of scope for this milestone (tracked separately):** the
`POST /webhooks/vapi` event/tool-call handler, token creation or
cancellation via voice, call analytics/transcript storage.
